# Pinterest Fashion Dataset Analysis

This project is an extensive analysis of the Pinterest Fashion Dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and building a retrieval-augmented generation system for product recommendation based on demographic data.

## Overview

The analysis is divided into two main parts:
1. **Data Analysis**: Involves cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the fashion dataset.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Development of a system that utilizes user queries and demographic data to recommend fashion items.

## Installation

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
